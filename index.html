Art 22 Final Project Proposal 
<br>
For my final project, I would like to make a code generated digital animation. I might incorporate a short story into my piece depending on how the first scene comes out. For the short story, I will try to add a scene or two or upload a small image gallery to suggest the change of scenes in the short story. 
<br>
I will be using the p5 Javascript library for a majority of the project. After setting the scene with javascript, I want to use some HTML and CSS to incorporate an array of images for a small gallery as part of my short story. 
<br>
My biggest inspiration for this final project comes from two of my favorite electronic music producers, and their visual effects artists, that went on tour together last year. It is approaching their one year tour anniversary, so I would like to dedicate my project to them. The visuals produced for their concert are colorful, beautiful, and bring back great memories for me as well as a majority of their fan base. The main setting of the art piece will be their concert’s stage setup. I will also try to recreate one of the visuals that they used in their show. 
<br>
Ultimately, my goal is to provide my own reinterpretation of their concert experience by recreating the visuals. Although I am missing the musical component for this recreation of a concert experience, I want to show my audience that artists can combine electronic music and beautiful digital art to create a story.
