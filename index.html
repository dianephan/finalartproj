Art 22 Final Project Proposal 
<br>
For my final project, I would like to make a code generated digital animation where I display a short story based on a music video of one of my favorite songs. For the short story, I will try to add a scene or two or upload a small image gallery to suggest the change of scenes in the short story. 
                  
<br>
I will be using the p5 Javascript library for a majority of the project. After setting the scene with javascript, I want to use some HTML and CSS to incorporate an array of images to display the performance visuals on the two visual panels on each side of the stage.
                  
                  
<br>
My biggest inspiration for this final project comes from two of my favorite electronic music producers, and their visual effects artists, that went on tour together last year. It is approaching their one year tour anniversary, so I would like to dedicate my project to them. The visuals produced for their concert are colorful, beautiful, and bring back great memories for me as well as a majority of their fan base. The main setting of the art piece will be their concert’s stage setup. I will also try to recreate one of the most memorable scenes of their 1 hour performance.  
<br>
Ultimately, my goal is to provide my own reinterpretation of their concert experience by showcasing the visuals. I am not sure if I can add the musical component for this piece, but I just want to show my audience the stage design, unique visuals, and the digital art from the 6 minute music video that comes together to create a story.
